# Rum
A Vim-like text editor in Rust
---

The backbone of editor is based on a tutorial named Hecto.[link](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial) **BIG CREDIT AND BIG THANK TO @pflenker** The tutorial gives me the basic concept of Rust and the structure is relatively clear and clean.

I found Rust is an elegent and efficient language, and writing a vim-like editor in Rust is interesting and easier to maintain in the long run.

## Roadmap

- [] mode transition
- [] customize using yaml file
